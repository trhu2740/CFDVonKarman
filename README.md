# Background
This simulation was my final project for MCEN 4231/5231 Computaional Fluid Dynamics in Spring 2024. It was a simulation to study the von Karman vortex shedding effect in different situations / geometries. 

# How to run
The root of this directory contains the very last render, the two-way von Karman with fins (two outlet). The rest of the renders are contained in the AllRenders directory with their corresponding geo, msh, and python file that is already setup. You will need to have your environment setup with FEniCS/DOLFINx to run the simulation. However, the gifs are visible below as a reference. Feel free to email me at trhu2740@colorado.edu for the high definition videos or for more information.
